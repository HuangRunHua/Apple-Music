# Music Lyrics scrolling animation effect
Since the iOS/iPadOS 13 update, Apple has brought a new scrolling lyrics feature to Apple Music. The album image is used as the background with Gaussian blur. The highlighted lyrics of the current sentence seem to be floating on the surface of the water and are very eye-catching; while the lyrics behind, seem to be looming in the deep water.

## Introduction
This small project aims to imitate the scrolling effect of Apple Music lyrics and does not have the rest of the software's functions. Some screenshots of the project are as follows.
